# Python practice

This repository contains sets of exercises in python, intended originally for
Pili to complete. The exercises consist of a number of empty functions in files
in the 'problems' directory. When completing the exercises, copy the file your
working on to 'pili_solutions' and work on your copy.

Files contain their own tests, so to see if your solution is working, run the
file using python.
